# Case Study 

The Diplomatic sales team at Volvo needed help generating new leads. We rolled out a series of websites using modular design components.  

# My Role 

  ***I designed landing pages in Adobe XD, implementing building an art direction from Volvo's commissioned image bank. I coordinated with language, design, web dev agencies, and the Volvo team to complete this project.***

## XC90 Recharge

**Going Electric**

The XC90 Recharge electric vehicle is part of Volvo's new all-electric fleet. With the XC90 Recharge, you go through life in a powerful but eco-friendly way. With feature interior and exterior materials that speak to comfort. The unique design of the XC90 allows passengers to experience the vehicle more as a space rather than a mode of transportation. To accompany the global launch in 2021.

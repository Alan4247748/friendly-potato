# XC90 Recharge

**Going Electric**

The XC90 Recharge electric vehicle is part of Volvo's new all-electric fleet. With the XC90 Recharge, you go through life in a powerful but eco-friendly way. With feature interior and exterior materials that speak to comfort. The unique design of the XC90 allows passengers to experience the vehicle more as a space rather than a mode of transportation. To accompany the global launch in 2021. 


# Website Example

```python

````

# Results

The sales team saw a significant bump in leads generated.

## The Problem

Addestino, a leading Belgian IT consultancy, sought a fresh brand identity, and communication startegy. The consultants at Addestino steer European enterprises through the intricate juncture where business meets technology. 

This entailed dissecting specific challenges, managing in-house projects, and constructing case studies that highlighted their proficiency, strategy, and triumphs.

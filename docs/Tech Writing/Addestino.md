## The Problem

Addestino, a boutique Belgian IT consultancy, sought a fresh brand identity, and communication startegy. The consultants at Addestino steer European enterprises through the intricate juncture where business meets technology. 

This entailed dissecting specific challenges, in-house projects, and constructing case studies that highlighted their approach, strategy, and technical acumen.

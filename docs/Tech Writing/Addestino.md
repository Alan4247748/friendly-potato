# The Problem

Addestino, a Belgian IT consultancy, helps European businesses navigate a complex landscape: where business and technology intersect. I worked with them on ***(communicating)*** specific problems, and how they were solved.

# My Role

As a Tech writer, I conducted technical interviews to produce a variety of content, including case studies, market analysis reports, technology updates, newsletters, linkedin posts, and profile pieces. To showcase Addestino's extensive capabilities and projects solving customers problems.

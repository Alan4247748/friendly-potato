If I built a botnet, which I wouldn't, (ITS ILLEGAL), but the best way is to combine the concepts of fast flux, IoT networks, and Wi-Fi routers. 

## Fast Flux Networks

Is a DNS technique used by botnets to hide phishing and malware delivery sites behind an ever-changing network of compromised hosts acting as proxies. It involves rapidly changing the DNS records (like A or MX records) to point to a different set of IP addresses at frequent intervals. This can make it difficult for law enforcement and security professionals to locate the rogue servers behind these changing IP addresses.

**P2P Network** 

In a P2P network, each participant acts as both a client and a server, which contrasts with the traditional client-server model. P2P is often used by botnets to decentralize their command and control infrastructure, making it harder to take down the entire botnet by targeting a single server.

**Fast Flux in P2P**

 Fast flux can be implemented in a P2P network where each node (or agent) in the P2P network can serve as a proxy for malicious content or actions. By rapidly changing which nodes are being used as proxies (akin to the fast flux technique), attackers can keep the origin of the malicious content or instructions hidden.

**Agents with Control**

In this combined architecture, specific nodes or "agents" can be given more control or priority in the decision-making process, either because they are more trusted by the bot herder or they have more resources available. This can be particularly useful for distributing commands, updates, or new malware samples to the rest of the botnet.

Combining fast flux with P2P offers redundancy, resilience, and obfuscation. However, it's also more complex to set up and manage. Security researchers have developed various techniques to detect and counteract botnets using these and other obfuscation methods.


**Fast Flux + IoT** 

As discussed earlier, fast flux is a technique to rapidly change DNS records to hide the true source of malicious content or actions. Given that many IoT devices are poorly secured, they can be easily compromised and added to a botnet that utilizes fast flux. Such devices could act as ever-shifting proxies for malicious traffic.

**IoT and Wi-Fi Routers** 

IoT devices typically connect to the internet via home Wi-Fi routers. If an IoT device is compromised, it might be possible, depending on the nature of the device and its privileges on the network, to attack or probe other devices on the same network, including the router.

**Access to Router via IoT Device** 

Gaining access to an IoT device doesn't automatically grant access to the Wi-Fi router. However, if the compromised IoT device can be leveraged to exploit vulnerabilities in the router or sniff traffic to capture credentials, then yes, the attacker could gain access to the router. Many attacks exploit weak or default credentials, unpatched vulnerabilities, or other misconfigurations in the router.

**Potential Side affects**
    - **Traffic Interception** If the router is compromised, all traffic passing through it can potentially be intercepted, analyzed, or modified.
    - **DNS Hijacking** The router's DNS settings can be altered to point to malicious DNS servers, redirecting users to fraudulent websites even if they typed the correct URL.
    - **Spreading Malware** Other devices on the network can be targeted and infected.
    - **Being Part of a Botnet** The compromised router can become part of a botnet, participating in activities like DDoS attacks or fast flux networks.

## Defensive Measures

- **Change Default Credentials** Always replace default usernames and passwords on both IoT devices and routers.
- **Firmware Updates** Regularly update the firmware on devices and routers to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Network Segmentation** If possible, separate IoT devices from primary devices using different network segments or VLANs.
- **Secure Configurations** Disable unnecessary services, ensure encryption is used for communication, and employ strong, unique passwords.

In conclusion, while IoT devices offer convenience and innovative functionalities, they also introduce potential vulnerabilities into home networks. The interconnectedness of devices in modern networks mandates robust security practices to prevent potential compromise.

## Brute Force 

Wi-Fi router passwords, especially default ones, can be a significant vulnerability if not changed. As for your query, let's break it down:

1. **Brute-Forcing Default Router Passwords**

    - Many routers come with default credentials, often as simple as "admin/admin" or "admin/password." These are easily guessable and don't require brute-forcing.
    - For routers with default passwords based on predictable patterns (like MAC addresses or device types), attackers might use lookup tables or simple algorithms.
    - Brute-forcing random default passwords is more time-consuming but still possible, especially if the password space is limited (e.g., 8 alphanumeric characters).

2. **Brute-Forcing Wi-Fi Passwords**

    - WPA and WPA2 encryption for Wi-Fi have proven resistant to brute-forcing, especially if strong, long passwords are used. However, WEP, an older standard, is notably weak and can be cracked quickly.
    - The primary attack vector against WPA/WPA2 is the WPS PIN, if enabled. It's an 8-digit number, and due to its structure, it's effectively reduced to 10^4 + 10^3 possibilities, making brute-forcing feasible.
    - Another common method against WPA/WPA2 is capturing the 4-way handshake and then using offline brute force or dictionary attacks. This method's effectiveness depends on the password's strength.

3. **Old Cellphones with Wi-Fi Credentials**

    - If someone possesses old cellphones that have stored Wi-Fi credentials, they might use those credentials to access networks without brute-forcing. This would, of course, be illegal and unethical.
    - However, using these devices to start a botnet requires more than just Wi-Fi access. The attacker would need to compromise devices on that network or use that network for malicious activities, which would raise suspicions.

4. **IoT and Botnets**

    - Many botnets nowadays target IoT devices. If an IoT device is compromised and has stored Wi-Fi credentials, it could be used to spread the infection to other nearby networks. This is one reason why securing IoT devices is crucial.

**Preventative Measures**

- Always change default credentials on routers.
- Use strong, unique passwords for Wi-Fi networks.
- Disable WPS or ensure that its PIN is strong and changed regularly.
- Regularly update firmware and software on all devices, including routers.
- Monitor network traffic for unusual activity.

In conclusion, while brute-forcing is a method employed by attackers, the vast number of insecure devices, default passwords, and human errors often provide easier avenues for network compromise. As for old cellphones, while they might store valuable credentials, converting that access into a functional botnet is a more involved process.


## Botnet Propagation Techniques

**Worms** 

Self-propagating malware can spread to other systems automatically. If there's an exploitable vulnerability present on many systems, a worm can be an effective way to build a botnet quickly.

**Trojans** 

Malware disguised as legitimate software can be inadvertently installed by users, adding their machines to a botnet.

**Drive-by Downloads** 

Simply visiting a malicious website or viewing a malicious ad can lead to malware being silently downloaded and executed on a user's system.

**Phishing and Social Engineering** 

Tricking users into executing malicious files or giving away credentials can be a method to compromise systems.

**Botnet Objectives** 

Once a botnet is established, it can be used for various malicious activities, including DDoS attacks, spamming, cryptocurrency mining, and more.

**IoT and Botnets** 

The rise of insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices has provided a new frontier for botnet builders. Many IoT devices have weak security postures, default credentials, and run outdated software, making them prime targets. Mirai, for instance, is a well-known botnet that primarily targets IoT devices.

While buffer overflows are a potential method for compromising systems and adding them to botnets, they are just one of many techniques in an attacker's arsenal. The common thread among all methods is the exploitation of vulnerabilities, whether they be in software, hardware, or human behavior. As such, regular software updates, security awareness training, and robust network defenses are crucial in mitigating the threat of botnets.

## Modern Browser Sandboxing 

Drive-by downloads refer to the unintentional download of malicious software onto a user's system simply by visiting an infected website. Modern browsers have indeed implemented various security measures, including sandboxing, to reduce the risk posed by drive-by downloads. However, while these measures have made drive-by downloads more challenging, they haven't entirely eliminated the threat. Here's why:

**Sandboxing** 

Modern browsers run web content in a restricted environment, a "sandbox," which limits the actions that content can take and prevents it from directly accessing the underlying system. This makes exploiting the system through the browser more difficult. However, if an attacker can find and exploit a vulnerability in the browser itself or its sandboxing mechanism, they might escape the sandbox and execute malicious actions on the host system.

**Zero-Day Vulnerabilities** 

These are previously unknown vulnerabilities in software. Even modern browsers with robust security features can have zero-days. If attackers discover such a vulnerability before it's patched, they can exploit it for malicious purposes, including drive-by downloads.

**Plugin Vulnerabilities** 

Historically, plugins like Flash, Java, and others were common attack vectors for drive-by downloads. Although their use has decreased significantly and browsers have implemented click-to-play features or removed support entirely, any remaining plugins can still be potential weak points.

**Social Engineering** 

Some drive-by downloads rely less on exploiting software vulnerabilities and more on tricking users. For instance, a website might display a fake error message saying the user needs to download and install a "video player" to view content. The "player" is malware.

**Compromised Legitimate Websites** 

Sometimes, attackers inject malicious code into legitimate websites. This makes it harder for users to avoid drive-by downloads simply by staying away from sketchy sites.

**Advanced Threat Actors** 

State-sponsored groups or advanced persistent threat (APT) actors might employ sophisticated techniques that can bypass even modern browser defenses. While such actors typically have specific targets, their tools and methods can sometimes be found in the wild, used by other cybercriminals.

**Browser and OS Integrations**

Some browsers are deeply integrated with their operating systems (e.g., Microsoft Edge with Windows). Vulnerabilities that arise from these integrations can potentially be used for drive-by attacks, although OS vendors are continually working on hardening these integrations.

## Explot Kits

However, some exploit kits and campaigns have been observed targeting them, as well as exploiting older Wi-Fi networks:

**Safari**
    - **WebKit Exploits** WebKit is the engine behind Safari. Over the years, various vulnerabilities in WebKit have been targeted. For instance, in early 2020, a series of zero-day vulnerabilities were discovered in WebKit, which allowed malicious websites to execute code on devices that visited them.
    - **Pegasus Spyware** This is a famous example of a sophisticated tool that exploited vulnerabilities in mobile Safari to root iPhones and install spyware.
    
**Google Chrome**
    - **Magnitude Exploit Kit** Known to target Chrome vulnerabilities alongside other browsers. In 2019, a Chrome zero-day (CVE-2019-5786) was found being exploited in the wild, and Magnitude was quick to integrate this exploit.
    - **WizardOpium** In late 2019, a North Korean hacker group was associated with exploiting a Chrome zero-day (CVE-2019-13720) as part of the WizardOpium campaign.
    - **Chrome Exploits in EKs** Over time, various exploit kits have tried to incorporate Chrome exploits, but the browser's rapid update mechanism often patches vulnerabilities quickly, making them short-lived in EKs.

**Old Wi-Fi Networks & Routers**

    - **Moon Worm** This malware targeted Linksys routers, exploiting an authentication bypass vulnerability. Infected routers would then scan for other routers to infect.
    - **VPNFilter** A multi-stage malware that infected many router brands, it had capabilities to sniff traffic, steal credentials, and even brick the device.
    - **Router Exploit Kits (e.g., GhostDNS)** These are more targeted toolkits designed to change DNS settings in routers, redirecting users to malicious websites. They often exploit default credentials or known vulnerabilities in router firmware.
    - **Moose Malware** This malware targeted routers and other IoT devices, with a particular emphasis on stealing social media credentials.

For all systems, including Safari and Chrome, it's essential to remember that no software is invulnerable. Regularly updating systems and software, disabling unused features or plugins, and employing a robust security solution will go a long way in keeping devices safe. For routers, changing default credentials, regularly updating firmware, and disabling unnecessary features (like remote administration) are critical steps.

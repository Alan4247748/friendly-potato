The Adobe EMEA studio needed assistance with re-purposing content.

# My Role 

  ***Let's be honest, no-one wants to read a 40 page report. When it comes to posting for the web ideas need to be concise. In this project I read several market research reports and distilled them into 1500-word blog posts.***

# Looking closer at Retail Personalisation

One focus area was retail personalization. With the popularity of online shopping and abundant customer data, retailers aimed to enhance shopping experiences through personalized recommendations and tailored marketing strategies.

Our goal was to explore the impact of retail personalization in Europe, identify insights, and share them through articles. Understanding regional challenges and opportunities helped European retailers implement or improve personalization efforts.

# Data: The most important inventory 

```python
Data played a crucial role in our research and analysis. It helped us understand customer behavior, preferences, and retail trends. We utilized various data sources, including customer transaction records, browsing patterns, and demographics.

By analyzing data, we determined responsive customer segments, frequently purchased products, and effective conversion channels. These insights enabled retailers to optimize personalization efforts and tailor marketing messages.

Data served as the most important inventory, allowing us to provide evidence-based recommendations and actionable insights for European-focused articles that resonated with retailers in the region.

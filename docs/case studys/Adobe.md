# The Problem

The Adobe EMEA studio needed assistance with content creation. 
Adobe commissions a lot of industry research. 
And needs that turned into European focused articles. 

# My Role 

  ***Let's be honest, no-one wants to read a 40 page report. When it comes to posting for the web ideas need to be concise. In this project I read several market research reports and distilled them into 1500-word blog posts.***

 - 60% Research
 - 40% Copywriting

# Looking closer at Retail Personalisation

# Data: The most important inventory 

```python

# Results

- Thanks to our efforts, Volvo is now able to target and attract high-value diplomatic customers. 
- Sales Reps have personalised websites in their sales tool kits. 
- Combined with google ads campaigns the result was a powerful lead generation system.

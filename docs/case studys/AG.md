## (Reference Text)

Project number #1 - I wrote, edited, and gathered data from a variety of sources to create the sustainability report. I assisted the graphic design team with micro text and overall art direction of the 49-page document.

Project number #2 - AG ran a "get the word out campaign," and I wrote the English VO script while coordinating with Dutch and French versions.

# The Problem

AG Insurance faced the challenge of effectively communicating their sustainability efforts and raising awareness about their initiatives among their stakeholders. They needed to create impactful communication materials to showcase their commitment to sustainability and engage their target audience.

# My Role

As part of the team at AG Insurance, I played a crucial role in developing and executing the communication materials for the sustainability initiatives. I was involved in two key projects that contributed to AG Insurance's sustainability communication efforts.

# Sustainability Report

In project number #1, I took the lead in writing, editing, and gathering data from various sources to create AG Insurance's sustainability report. This comprehensive 67-page document highlighted the company's sustainability achievements, goals, and strategies. Additionally, I collaborated closely with the graphic design team to provide micro text and offer overall art direction for the report, ensuring a visually appealing and informative final product.

# Promo Video

In project number #2, AG Insurance launched a "get the word out campaign" to increase awareness about their sustainability efforts. As part of this campaign, I was responsible for crafting the voice-over (VO) script for the promotional video. The video, produced in multiple languages, including Dutch and French, aimed to engage and educate the target audience about AG Insurance's sustainability initiatives in an engaging and compelling manner.

Here is the promo video:

# Results

The communication materials developed for AG Insurance's sustainability initiatives yielded positive results. The sustainability report effectively conveyed AG Insurance's commitment to sustainability and provided stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the company's efforts in this area. The visually appealing design and clear presentation of data enhanced the report's impact.

The promo video created a buzz and generated awareness about AG Insurance's sustainability initiatives among the target audience. The multilingual approach ensured that the message reached a broader audience, fostering a sense of inclusivity and engagement.

Overall, these communication materials played a vital role in positioning AG Insurance as a responsible and sustainable organization, strengthening its reputation and building trust among stakeholders.

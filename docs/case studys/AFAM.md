# The Problem

The AFAM Group needed a website for products, brands, and services. Branding identity, multilingual copy and technical specs.


# My Role

As the copywriter on this project, I wrote about the nuances of acid, gel, and lithium ion batteries, sprockets, filters, and chains. I worked closely with the team to understand their unique value proposition, target audience, and key messages they wanted to communicate throughout the website.

# The Brands

The messaging focused on the needs of their customers, their technical requirements, and how the AFAM Group's technology could meet those needs. AFAM Group's range of brands are AFAM, NITRO, SHIDO, ISON, and MIW. Showcasing technical expertise, design, and data to to tailor the perfect fit for riders.

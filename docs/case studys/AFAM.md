# My Role

As the copywriter on this project, I learned the nuances between acid batteries, lithium ion acid batterys, sprockets, and chains. I worked closely with the team to understand their unique value proposition, target audience, and key messages they wanted to communicate throughout the website.

# The Website

Together with the design and development teams, we created a visually appealing and user-friendly website for the AFAM Group. I carefully crafted the copy to reflect their brand values, emphasizing their attention to design, development, and production of unrivaled quality products. The messaging focused on understanding the needs of their customers, their technical requirements, and how the AFAM Group's technology could meet those needs. Additionally, we highlighted the AFAM Group's range of brands, such as AFAM, NITRO, SHIDO, ISON, and MIW, showcasing their individual strengths while also emphasizing their cohesive unit and commitment to providing a perfect fit for riders.

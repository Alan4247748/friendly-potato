## The Campaign

The campaign spanned 8 different countries and involved the creation of banner ads, social media posts, and gif campaigns. It was designed to disseminate information related to the EU commissions efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Through collaboration with a diverse team, we ensured that the campaign resonated with the cultural nuances and sensitivities of the target audiences. We focused on delivering concise and impactful messages that would capture attention and encourage positive behavior change during the pandemic.

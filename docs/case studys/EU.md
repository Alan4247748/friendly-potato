# My Role

As part of the EU Commission team, I played a significant role in developing and implementing the campaign. I was responsible for creating the core messaging in English, which served as the foundation for the campaign's content across various languages and channels.

# The Campaign

The campaign spanned 8 different countries and involved the creation of banner ads, social media posts, and gif campaigns. It was designed to disseminate vital information related to COVID-19, including public health guidelines, safety precautions, and the importance of vaccination. The messaging, originally crafted in English, was carefully adapted and localized for each target language and country.

Through collaboration with a diverse team, we ensured that the campaign resonated with the cultural nuances and sensitivities of the target audiences. We focused on delivering concise and impactful messages that would capture attention and encourage positive behavior change during the pandemic.

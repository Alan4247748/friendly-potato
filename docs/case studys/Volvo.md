**Going Electric**

The XC90 Recharge electric vehicle is part of Volvo's new all-electric fleet. With the XC90 Recharge, you go through life in a powerful but eco-friendly way. With feature interior and exterior materials that speak to comfort. 

The unique design of the XC90 allows passengers to experience the vehicle more as a space rather than a mode of transportation. To accompany the global launch in 2021.

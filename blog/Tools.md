Learning new things can involve sorting through many tools, courses, and youtube rabbit holes. Optimization and process gurus abound, but if you are like me, you might landed at endless tool triage.

## The Developers' Dilemma

In the ever-evolving IT landscape, a constant steady stream of technologies, frameworks, and tools are constantly being invented. Ontop of that there is a thousand older technoliges also in use. This creates a challenging situation for new developers. 
```Where do I start?``` 
Especially during the early days of learning something new. Navigating the vast sea of options can be overwhelming and lead to giving up. 


## Selecting Tools 

When it comes to choosing the right tools, several factors come into play. Functionality, ease of use, compatibility with existing systems, cost considerations, and availability of support are all key aspects. 

Striking a balance between adopting well-established tools and exploring the fringes of available options is crucial. The fringes represent innovative tools or unconventional approaches that may offer unique insights or advantages, but they also carry some level of risk.

Open-source software (OSS) is an integral part of the  tool selection process. Freely available software, frameworks, and libraries that developers can leverage, test, and improve upon to meet their needs. 

## Endless-tool-triage 

The abundance of available tools often leads to the phrase I've coined "endless-tool-triage." This term describes the constant evaluation and selection process developers go through as they strive to find the best fit for their needs. Every tool promises something. Whether to streamline processes, enhance efficiency, or provide shortcuts, making it tempting to continuously explore new options. However, this perpetual search can become a time-consuming, frustrating, and counter productive. 

To tackle endless-tool-triage, developers need to strike a balance between staying up-to-date with emerging technologies and frameworks while being mindful of their specific project requirements and constraints. It's important to carefully assess the potential benefits, risks, and costs associated with adopting new tools, and to exercise discernment in selecting those that align most effectively with the project goals and long-term development strategy.

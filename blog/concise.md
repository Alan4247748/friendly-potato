## The Art of Brevity 

For as long as humans bave been communicating there has been a time and a place for conciseness. But this is not some drabby essay about how we have so much less attention span than yester-year. In fact, depth is possible - people starve for it. The medium is the message, is one of the most influential books I've ever read. 

It's a graphical novel - one that takes the reader through 15 different art styles, typographies, illustration styles, symbolizsim, text strucutre, for 100 pages.

## Signal over Noise 

It is one of the most impactful phrases, but a lot to unpack. If you think about your own life for a moment. How much information do you digest per day. How much time do you spend on a screen, or talking to other people, does it all rush and swirl around your head that you don't even realize how much you a apply a filter. 

People do this all the time, we develop a taste that tells us what types of movies we enjoy. Which bands we like and which concerts we go to, what portn we watch, which youtube videos to watch, which viral social media trends. 

However, parsing out the bad information fron the good has been a primary tenantet of the internet since its existence. Fundamentally. if you build a system - someone is going to try and spam it. Let's be honest, that is just human nature. 

We all "filter" our bubbles of information flows. Sometimes, sub-counsiously or I've heard many friends chagrinnly calling it "the algorithum."

## Build your own Filter 

## Twitter Eco

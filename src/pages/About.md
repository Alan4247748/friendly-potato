# Intro

I code in English - its - interpreted, general-purpose, and expressive. Like LISP, English is extend-able and programmable, and allows the use of MACROs.  Syntactic sugar galore, and the breaking changes are far and few between. The ecosystem, documentation, is matched by none. 

## Skills

- **Technical Writing**: I have a strong background in technical writing, including creating user manuals, API documentation, developer guides, and tutorials.
- **Communication**: I have excellent written and verbal communication skills, which allows me to effectively collaborate with developers, product managers, and other stakeholders to gather information and produce high-quality documentation.
- **Attention to Detail**: I pay close attention to detail and ensure that the documentation is accurate, comprehensive, and easy to understand.
- **Tools**: I am proficient in using various documentation tools and technologies, including Markdown, Git, and documentation platforms like Docusaurus.

## Experience

I have worked with several companies in the technology industry, contributing to their documentation efforts. I have experience documenting both web-based applications and APIs, as well as desktop software and mobile applications. I'm comfortable working in an agile environment and adapting to changing requirements.

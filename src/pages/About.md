# Intro

I code in English - its - interpreted, general-purpose, and expressive. Like LISP, English is extend-able and programmable, and allows the use of MACROs.  Syntactic sugar galore, and the breaking changes are far and few between. The ecosystem, documentation, is matched by none. 

## Skills

- **Technical Writing**: I have a strong background in technical writing, including IT roadmaps, case study's, technical articles, help docs, and tutorials.
- **Communication**: I can collaborate with developers, product people, and other stakeholders to produce high-quality docs.
- **Tools**: I am proficient in using various documentation tools and technologies, including Markdown, Git, and documentation platforms like Docusaurus.

I code in English - its - interpreted, general-purpose, and expressive. Like LISP, English is manipulatable, and allows for MACROs.  Syntactic sugar depends on taste. However, breaking changes are far and few between with an ecosystem that surpasses all.

## Skills

- **Technical Writing**: I know how to write case study's, blog posts, technical articles, help docs, SKDs, and tutorials.
- **Communication**: I can collaborate with developers, product people, and others to produce high-quality content.
- **Tools**: I've used various frameworks [Docusaurus](https://damurphy.com/docs/Tech%20Writing/Directory%20for%20website%20&%20content) and technologies: Markdown, Git, and documentation framweworks, i.e., Docusaurus. 


## Highlights

## The Story

I follow a first-principles approach to trial-&-error. In reality, it's (trying to) fall forward and a long list of ideas that didn't work as evidence. I studied at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, and squeaked out a degree in marketing. Worked in the oil fields of West, Texas and even tried an eco-hostel in Guatemala. I found writing in Berlin and (luckily) turned that experiment into a profession. I speak (Español B1.2) and (Deutsch B2.1) a self-taught programmer and an enthusiastic tinkerer.

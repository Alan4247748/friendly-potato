# My Story

I use a first-principles approach to trial-&-error. In reality, it's a lot of failing, and I've got a long list of them as evidence. I  squeaked out a degree in marketing and studied at Baylor University in Waco, Texas.  After, I worked in the oil fields of West Texas. I started writing in Berlin, Germany, and have turned that experiment into a profession. I speak (English native) (EspaÃ±ol B1.2) and (Deutsch B2.1). A self-taught programmer and an enthusiastic tinkerer.

# Skills

- **Technical Writing**: I've expereince writing case study's, blog posts, technical articles, help docs, SKDs, and tutorials.
- **Communication**: I can collaborate with developers, product people, and marketers, to create high-quality content.
- **Tools**: I've used various frameworks [Docusaurus](https://damurphy.com/docs/Tech%20Writing/Directory%20for%20website%20&%20content) as well as Markdown, Git, .css, .js, Lisp, microcontrollers, python, datadog, and more. 


# Highlights

# Nerdspeak

 I code in English - its - interpreted, general-purpose, and expressive. Like LISP, English is extendable, and allows for MACROs. Syntactic sugar depends on taste. However, breaking changes are far and few between with an ecosystem that surpasses all.

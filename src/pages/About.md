## Highlights 

> **I've written enough to learn; that context is everything, so it's best to keep it simple.**

>> **Clients: IT consultancies, tech startups, corporates, fashion labels, advertising agencies, and the EU.**

## Nerdspeak

I code in English - it's interpreted, general-purpose, and expressive. Like LISP, English is extendable and allows for MACROs. Syntactic sugar depends on taste. However, breaking changes are far and few between with an ecosystem that surpasses all.

## Skills

- **Technical Writing**: Wrote case studies, blog posts, technical articles, help docs, SKDs, and tutorials.
- **Communication**: Can collaborate with developers, product people, and marketers, and senior leadership.
- **Tools**: I've used tools and frameworks like [Docusaurus](https://damurphy.com/docs/Tech%20Writing/Directory%20for%20website%20&%20content) gatsby, markdown, jira, git, .CSS, .JS, CommonLisp, microcontrollers, python, homebrew, and datadog.


## Highlights 

> **I've written enough to learn; that context is everything, so it's best to keep it simple.**

>> **Clients: IT consultancies, tech startups, corporates, fashion labels, advertising agencies, and the EU.**

## Nerdspeak

- I code in English - it's interpreted, general-purpose, and expressive. Like LISP, English is extendable and allows for MACROs. Syntactic sugar depends on taste. However, breaking changes are far and few between with an ecosystem that surpasses all.
- **Language Proficiency:** Native in English, B1.2 in Espa√±ol, and B2.1 in Deutsch.

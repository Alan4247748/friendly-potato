I code in English - its - interpreted, general-purpose, and expressive. Like LISP, English is manipulatable, and allows for MACROs.  Syntactic sugar depends on taste. However, breaking changes are far and few between. With an ecosystem and documentation that surpasses all.

## Skills

- **Technical Writing**: I know how to write case study's, blog posts, technical articles, help docs, SKDs, and tutorials.
- **Communication**: I can collaborate with developers, product people, and other stakeholders to produce high-quality content.
- **Tools**: I've used various frameworks [Docusaurus](https://damurphy.com/docs/Tech%20Writing/Directory%20for%20website%20&%20content) and technologies: Markdown, Git, and documentation framweworks i.e., Docusaurus——among others.

## Education

I follow a first-principles approach to trial-&-error. In reality, it's (trying to) fall forward and a long list of ideas that didn't work as evidence. I studied at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, and squeaked out a degree in marketing. I began writing and (luckily) turned that experiment into a profession. I speak (Español B1.2) and (Deutsch B2.1) a self-taught programmer and an enthusiastic tinkerer.

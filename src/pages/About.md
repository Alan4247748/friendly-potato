# My Story

I follow a first-principles approach to trial-&-error. In reality, it's trying to fall forward and I have a long list of ideas that didn't work as evidence. I studied at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, and squeaked out a degree in marketing. Worked in the oil fields of West, Texas and had an eco-hostel in Guatemala (failure). I started writing in Berlin, Germany and have turned that experiment into a profession. I speak (English native) (EspaÃ±ol B1.2) and (Deutsch B2.1). A self-taught programmer and an enthusiastic tinkerer.

# Nerdspeak

 I code in English - its - interpreted, general-purpose, and expressive. Like LISP, English is extendable, and allows for MACROs. Syntactic sugar depends on taste. However, breaking changes are far and few between with an ecosystem that surpasses all.

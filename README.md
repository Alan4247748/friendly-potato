# Website

I used [Docusaurus 2], a static website generator, to build my portfolio Website. 

### Tools & Process

```
I used VSU as my IDE to do a website tranformation, write markdown files, add react components, etc.  
```

### Local Development

```
I used a NPM run build to generate static files & used Local server 3000
to test during dev sprints. 
```
### Deployment

```
I'm using GitHub as my cloud and Git as my local memory card to practice 
some continuous integration techniques. For deployment, I will be testing
Netlify (I know) and Vercel (I don't) to serve and deploy the final website.
```
